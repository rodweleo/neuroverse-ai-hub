# NeuroVerse AI Hub

A decentralized AI agent marketplace built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that enables users to create, deploy, and monetize AI agents in a fully decentralized environment.

## Overview

NeuroVerse AI Hub addresses the centralization problem in AI development by providing a platform where developers and users can create, share, and monetize AI agents without relying on traditional cloud infrastructure. 
Built on ICP's blockchain technology, it ensures permanent availability, transparent transactions, and true ownership of AI assets.
